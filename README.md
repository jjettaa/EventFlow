# Event Ticketing Platform â€“ Code Skeleton

## Overview
This project represents the **skeleton structure** of an Event Ticketing Platform.  
It follows a **3-layer architecture**: models (data layer), repositories (data access layer), and services (business logic layer).  
The purpose of this skeleton is to illustrate the overall system design and class responsibilities without implementing logic.
